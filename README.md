# StellarFever-Condensed
A SOURCE CODE only compilation of the code that I wrote for Stellar Fever.  This project WILL NOT compile or run properly.  
It has been stripped down to the key components that I worked on while leaving very little code written by other programmers

# About
I worked on a capstone game for college.  This is the collection of code that I wrote for the game. 
It includes the Editor Only module which I had set up so we could include functional testing.

# Key components
The following are the main tasks I was assigned with working on: 
Player Module |
Menu Module |
Networking Setup |
